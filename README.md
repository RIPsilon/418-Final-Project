# 418 Final Project: Gaming the System  

There simply isn't enough time to play every single possible video game. The library of games also continues to increase with each passing day. The main problem then becomes deciding what games are worthwhile to play.  
Data collection from GameFAQs was done in order to start the game selection process. After doing so, I applied K-Means clustering as an objective(purely based on the numbers) method for determining which games are worth playing. I also made a Shiny App (can be accessed at https://ripsilon.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/ until June 11, 2019) to help narrow down games based on what I am looking for in a game.  

# Notes  
Details on the data collection process can be found in the "Project Proposal" folder.  
Details on my two game selection methods can be found in the "The rest of the project" folder.  
My collected data can be accessed in the data.csv file.  
My write-up can be accessed in the Gaming_the_System.pdf file.  
This project was done mainly for personal use. I chose RPG's because RPG's are my favorite genre and focused on the systems DS, PSP, SNES, PS1 and PS2 because my backloggery for those systems is still very large.
